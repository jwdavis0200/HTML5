                    I am a second-year computer science student at NUS with a passion for programming and automating workflows. I enjoy developing projects that simplify my daily tasks and increase productivity.<br>
                    My eagerness to learn and strong problem-solving skills make me a valuable asset to any team, and I am excited to contribute to the success of your organization.<br><br>
                    Beyond my technical skills, I am a highly motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. I am always eager to take on new challenges and push myself outside of my comfort zone. <br><br>
                    In addition, I am a strong collaborator and enjoy working in team environments where I can learn from and contribute to others.

                    <br>As a computer science student, I found this internship to be extremely valuable to my education and career aspirations.<br><br>
                    While the role did not involve programming, it provided me with a unique opportunity to explore the rapidly-evolving field of fintech and gain hands-on experience working in a dynamic environment.<br> Through my responsibilities in industry research, due diligence, and analysis, I was able to deepen my knowledge of the fintech landscape and understand how technology is changing the way we think about banking and finance.

                    <br>In addition, I was able to apply my technical skills in a practical setting, specifically in the areas of risk assessment and proof of concept validation.<br>These experiences helped me to hone my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which will undoubtedly be valuable assets as I continue my studies in computer science.
                    <br><br>Overall, this internship provided me with a well-rounded understanding of the fintech industry and how technology is shaping the future of banking. <br><br> I believe that this experience has made me a more well-rounded and valuable candidate in the tech industry, and I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of technology and finance in my future career.

                    During my internship at Goldskye Engineering as a Sales Coordinator, I effectively managed sales activities and proposed solutions to improve operations and sales. <br><br>Despite being a computer science student, I quickly adapted to the fast-paced working environment and learned about engineering to deliver work efficiently. <br>Additionally, I displayed excellent teamwork skills by working with colleagues of various backgrounds and age groups to maintain business operations during the pandemic. <br><br>
                    The internship has enhanced my project management skills and adaptability in a fast-paced working environment, which will be valuable in my future career as a tech professional.
