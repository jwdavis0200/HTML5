            I am a second-year computer science student at NUS with a passion
            for programming and automating workflows. I enjoy developing
            projects that simplify my daily tasks and increase productivity.<br /><br />
            My eagerness to learn and strong problem-solving skills make me a
            valuable asset to any team, and I am excited to contribute to the
            success of your organization.<br /><br />
            Beyond my technical skills, I am a highly motivated individual with
            a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. I am always eager to
            take on new challenges and push myself outside of my comfort zone.
            <br /><br />
            In addition, I am a strong collaborator and enjoy working in team
            environments where I can learn from and contribute to others.

              A Python app created using customtkinter framework and langchain.
              <br /><br />
              This was done as a personal interest during the start of 2023 when
              interest in Artificial Intelligence Large Language Model became
              rampant. As a personal interest and seeing the importance of
              learning how to utilise these models from a software engineering
              perspective, this project was done personally and in two weeks.
              Features include chatting over personal documents, image
              recognition and web search.

              A Javascript app created using firebase and react-redux toolkit.
              <br /><br />
              This web application was created as a personal project that
              focuses on call-to-action and planning the day ahead. The app UI
              was designed using figma. Firebase allows for persistence for each
              user that is logged in to their account using the app. Redux
              allows for ease of maintenance of code as well as to prevent the
              need for prop-drilling. The app is optimised for laptop/desktop
              monitors. I have deployed a live version of this app

              A Discord-clone app created using Python and Django using MySQL as
              backend.
              <br /><br />
              This web application was created as a personal project to learn
              Django, a highly sought after skill in the current industry
              landscape. Django uses an MVC pattern to make web application
              development maintainable through modularity. The built-in backend
              framework including built-in REST API allows for ease of ORM
              management, allowing faster time-to-market and code scalability.
              The application uses a template to provide a user-friendly
              workflow. This application serves a unique purpose of connecting
              individuals with shared interests in exploring various concepts,
              not limited to programming.
